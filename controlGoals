This first part of the document is the requirements the robot should meet. Then we list some tasks that are specific to vision that are implied by the requirements.  
There are detailed things the robot needs to do described here that now we should turn into Github tasks. Things highlighted in yellow still need definition.

**Vision tasks**

1. Generate robot poses based on field coordinates such that the swerve drive can autonomously generate a path from sensed current pose to target pose.  
2. Define poses with appropriate offsets for coral scoring for the 12 possible reef positions, plus processor and 3 cage positions for Red and Blue alliances   
3. Possibly define poses to assist in taking coral directly from the human player station (collect from the ground in front of the station?)  
4. Acquire coral: sense coral relative position and orientation  
5. Score coral: Define any additional alignment desired during positioning   
6. Acquire algae: sense algae relative position on the field  
7. Score algae in processor: confirm position on the field relative to appropriate April Tag for red and blue alliance sides 

\_\_\_\_\_\_  
To define: tests that we are meeting the requirements above   
**Testbeds and testing**  
Vision testbed  
Swerve testbed  
Testing the robot in the gym for flat-out use  
Testing the robot interactions with the field elements  
Testing the code on the simulator  
Driver training and interaction testing  
What testing should be assigned to which testbed? What are fidelity limitations?  
Find our cycle time for various tasks and see how repeatable the time is. (Example: how long does it take to pick up and score a coral on levels 2, or 3, or 4?) Advanced teams will ask about this when doing alliance interviewing..  
\_\_\_\_\_\_

To define: How much more software documentation we want, and how to get that on Github. (Example: I would like to see what is being posted and read in network tables, and what code libraries/modules are reading and writing that data.)
